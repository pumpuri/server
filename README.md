# Why Does the School need the server?
Minecraft is a great way for people to connect and relieve stress - Especially during theese tough times when school is really hard with all the online learning, a lot of pressure and much more. Minecraft can also be used as an educational tool for example - Everyone could speak only English to speed up the learning curve for newer students!

# What would be on the server?
We would make multiple gamemodes for the students to enjoy!
* Survival Minecraft
  * The classic Minecraft experience. Everythings vannila but with some quality of life changes.
* Speedrunning
  * Students compete on the fastest time! The best time of the week gets a prize on the Survival Server
* Creative
  * Everyone gets access to every single block in the game and a 64x64 plot to build whatever they want!
* And more.
